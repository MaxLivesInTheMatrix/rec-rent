The battery is a class-leading 705.6Wh made with LG cells, which is why the Discover 2 can take you up to 75 miles on a single charge. There’s no better way to explore than with an e-bike, and with this much range, the adventures are endless! Riders can customize their experience with three power modes: Eco, Trail, and Boost, each offering five power levels for a total of 15 acceleration curves to give you just the amount of power you need and fine-tune your ride."
